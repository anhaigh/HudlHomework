# Technical assignment based around Hudl login page functionality

Project Description:
This project consist of a variety of automated test using Selenium that test the funtionality of various Log In page componenets.  This project was written in C#, which I have the most familiarity with, but could be written in variety of languages.  The estimation time for the assignment was around two hours, so I stuck as closely to that estimate as I could.
